# ATM-Project
ATM python project

== Welcome to ATM System ==

Create a bank account class that has two attributes:

• owner

• balance

and methods:

• constructor

• deposit

• withdraw

• login

• balance

(Let's suppose your bank account balance is $1,500)

First the user has to enter a password (PIN = 123456 or whatever). When the password matches, the system proceeds to the next features:

1: Withdraw Amount

You can't withdraw more than the amount in your account

2: Deposit Amount

You can deposit any value greater than zero

3: Balance

Will display your amount in your bank account

When depositing or withdrawing, the user enters the amount they want to withdraw or deposit. The system then calculates the total remaining balance and displays it to the user. The user has the option to withdraw, deposit or check balance multiple times, until they decide to log off!
